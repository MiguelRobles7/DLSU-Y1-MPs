# DLSU Year 1 Machine Projects
A compilation of my machine projects (major course outputs) from my first year at De La Salle University (DLSU) that required coding. _The projects are compiled because they are all pretty small._ 
## Donkey Game
Machine Project for my Logic Formulation and Introductory Programming Class (CCPROG1). A variation of crossing games. Made to be compatible with Windows and Linux. 

## Embarkation System
Machine Project for my Programming with Structured Data Types Class (CCPROG2). A simplified console version of DLSU's shuttle embarkation system. 

## Modified Checkers
Machine Project for my Discrete Structures Class (CCDSTRU). The task was to translate instructions described in a combination of discrete structures and mathematics and code the translated project. The translated project turns out to be a modified game of checkers.
